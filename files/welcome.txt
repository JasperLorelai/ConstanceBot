Welcome to ***My Hero Academia Apollo***, a Minecraft server based on the **Boku No Hero Academia** manga and anime.

On the server you can try your luck by rolling a quirk crate to see what powers you will be handed to complete quests, roleplay or battle others to become the Number 1. As we host events you can have the opportunity to earn special awards and money. Special rewards can even mean getting a specific quirk. So what are you waiting for? Type in the IP and start playing! Go further beyond, PLUS ULTRA!

*P.S. The server is not modded, all of our content is made with the help of plugins and our wonderful staff!*
**You must follow the server rules, it is the only requirement.** *If you need any help, most of our staff are available on Discord. Even if no staff are online our Minecraft chat is linked to a Discord channel where they can help.*
